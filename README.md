# Pokemon React Query

This project demonstrates the use of paginated and infinite queries in React Query using a Pokemon API.

## About

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Paginated Queries**: This part of the project demonstrates how to fetch data in pages. When the user navigates to a new page, React Query fetches the data for that page and keeps it in sync with the server.

2. **Infinite Queries**: This part of the project demonstrates how to fetch data in an "infinite" manner. As the user scrolls, new data is fetched and appended to the existing data. This is useful for creating a "load more" button or an infinite scroll feature.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pokemon-react-query.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the project: `npm start`

## Usage

After starting the project, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. You can switch between paginated and infinite queries using the navigation links at the top of the page.
